Optional Installation Steps

  These steps will let you tweak and customize the RJ_InsertCode plugin. They
  require knowing where you installed RJ_InsertCode to on your website. Lets
  quickly run through a scenario of where that might be.

  If you know where your TinyMCE installation is, then the RJ_InsertCode
  plugin will be in the "plugins/rj_insertcode" folder under your TinyMCE
  folder. If you are unsure of where your TinyMCE is located, here is one
  example.

  If you are using the JCE editor for Joomla 1.5, and you have Joomla
  installed at "http://www.example.com/MyJoomla", then you can find TinyMCE at
  "http://www.example.com/MyJoomla/plugins/editors/jce/tiny_mce".
	
  1) Change supported languages.

     This plugin uses GeSHi (http://qbnz.com/highlighter/) to perform the
     code highlighting. To remove a supported language, delete the
     "[RJ_INSERTCODE_FOLDER]/geshi/geshi/[LANGUAGE_NAME].php" file. You can
     also add support for new languages by uploading GeSHi language files
     to the same directory.
 
     If you wanted to disable highlighting for C++ and you would delete
     the "[RJ_INSERTCODE_FOLDER]/geshi/geshi/cpp.php" file.  

  2) Support class based style sheets.

     By default, code will be highlighted using inline style information. If
     you are highlighting large blocks of code, this can result in a large
     amount of generated HTML. To reduce the size of your HTML code, you can
     choose to use "class style sheets" from the code editing dialog. The only
     catch is that you need to link the style sheets into your website for it
     to do you much good.

     To create cascading style sheet files for your supported languages, you
     can load "[RJ_INSERTCODE_FOLDER]/php/rj_cssgen.php" in your browser. This
     will let you generate style sheets for any individual language or generate
     a style sheet combining all supported languages. You can then upload your
     new css file(s) and add them to your website.
